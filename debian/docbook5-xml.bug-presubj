When sending us a report, please note, that we won't change the schemas just
for Debian. Changes to schemas need to be coordinated with the OASIS TC
(Technical Committee) http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/docbook/.
Therefor please consider to send all questions, comments, concerns, and bug
reports directly to the DocBook mailing list: docbook@lists.oasis-open.org.
