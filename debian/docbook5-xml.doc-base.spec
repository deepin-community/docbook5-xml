Title: The DocBook 5.0 Schema
Author: Norman Walsh and the OASIS
Abstract: DocBook is a general purpose [xml-rec] schema particularly
 well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software
 (though it is by no means limited to these applications).
 .
 The Version 5.0 release is a complete rewrite of DocBook in RELAX NG.
 The intent of this rewrite is to produce a schema that is true to the
 spirit of DocBook while simultaneously removing inconsistencies that
 have arisen as a natural consequence of DocBook's long, slow evolution.
 The Technical Committee has taken this opportunity to simplify a
 number of content models and tighten constraints where RELAX NG makes
 that possible.
 .
 The Technical Committee provides the DocBook 5.0 schema in other schema
 languages, including W3C XML Schema and an XML DTD, but the RELAX NG
 Schema is now the normative schema.
